# Basic Linear Algebra implementations.
#   Only the bare-minimum of functionality will be found. This is not to be used as a catch-all implementation
#   Since this is an experiment only what I find necessary will be implemented.
#   It will also be limited in scope to specifically 2D linear algebra.
